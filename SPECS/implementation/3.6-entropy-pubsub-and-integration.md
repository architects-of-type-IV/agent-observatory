# Section 3.6: Entropy PubSub & SchemaInterceptor Integration

## Purpose

This section wires `EntropyTracker` into the `SchemaInterceptor` pipeline established in Phase 2, implements the Gateway-authoritative score overwrite on the `DecisionLog` envelope, configures the Session Cluster Manager LiveView's `"gateway:entropy_alerts"` subscription and deduplication logic, and verifies that all three `Application.get_env` configuration reads occur per-call with correct fallback behavior. These tasks cover FR-9.8 through FR-9.11.
