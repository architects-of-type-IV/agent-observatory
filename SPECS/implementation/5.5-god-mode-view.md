# Section 5.5: God Mode View and Global Instructions

## Purpose

This section implements the full `GodModeComponents` module covering FR-12.11, FR-12.12, and FR-12.13. God Mode introduces a double-confirmation kill-switch tracked by `kill_switch_confirm_step` cycling through `nil | :first | :second`, danger-zone CSS classes enforced structurally, and a Global Instructions panel with per-agent-class editors, single-step inline confirmation, and PubSub dispatch on confirmed push.
