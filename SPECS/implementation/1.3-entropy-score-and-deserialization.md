# Section 1.3: Entropy Score Overwrite & Deserialization

## Purpose

This section implements the Gateway-side entropy score overwrite helper on the `DecisionLog` struct (FR-6.7), the `from_json/1` deserialization entry point that accepts a decoded JSON map and returns a validated struct or error changeset (FR-6.8), and the regression test suite for the six UI derivation anchor fields (FR-6.9). These three tasks complete the schema module's public API surface: by the end of this section, `DecisionLog` exposes `changeset/2`, `root?/1`, `major_version/1`, `put_gateway_entropy_score/2`, and `from_json/1`, and all six anchor fields are regression-locked by name.
