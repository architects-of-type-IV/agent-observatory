# Section 2.3: SchemaViolationEvent & Security

## Purpose

This section implements two behaviors that must occur on every validation rejection: construction of the `SchemaViolationEvent` plain map (with the raw payload hash security policy enforced) and broadcast of that event on `"gateway:violations"`. These behaviors are implemented in `SchemaInterceptor` as helper functions called by the controller's rejection path. All raw payload security constraints (no logging, no ETS, no `"raw_payload"` key in the event) are enforced by the test suite.
