# Task 3.5.1: Uniqueness Ratio Computation

## Goal

The entropy score is `unique_count / window_size` using exact tuple equality, rounded to 4 decimal places. Computation is synchronous and occurs within the same process call as `record_and_score/2`. For partial windows, the ratio is computed over the available N entries.

## Governing Decisions

- ADR-018

## Verification UCs

- UC-0243
