title: "Write parameterized tests for all four valid action.status atoms"
status: pending
task_id: "1.2.1"
governed_by: ["ADR-014"]
parent_uc: ["UC-0203"]

goal: "Write a parameterized test in decision_log_test.exs that calls changeset/2 with each of success, failure, pending, and skipped and asserts valid? == true and apply_changes returns the correct atom"
allowed_files:
  - test/observatory/mesh/decision_log_test.exs
blocked_by: ["1.1.2.3"]
steps:
  - In decision_log_test.exs, add a test that iterates over ["success", "failure", "pending", "skipped"]
  - For each, call DecisionLog.changeset with action.status set to that string
  - Assert Ecto.Changeset.valid?(changeset) == true for each
  - Assert apply_changes(changeset).action.status equals the corresponding atom
done_when: "mix test test/observatory/mesh/decision_log_test.exs"
