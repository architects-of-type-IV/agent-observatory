# Section 2.2: HTTP Endpoint & 422 Rejection

## Purpose

This section wires the HTTP surface: a `:api` pipeline with JSON body parsing, the `POST /gateway/messages` route, and `ObservatoryWeb.GatewayController` with both the success (202) and rejection (422) branches. The controller calls `SchemaInterceptor.validate/1` as its first action. All router and controller changes must compile and all gateway controller tests must pass before proceeding to Section 2.3.

## Tasks
