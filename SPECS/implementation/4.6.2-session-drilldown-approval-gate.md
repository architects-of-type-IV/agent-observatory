# Task 4.6.2: Session Drill-down Approval Gate UI

## Goal

Implement the approval gate UI in the Session Drill-down LiveView. Subscribe to `"session:hitl:#{session_id}"` in `mount/3`, display the approval gate with buffered message content on `HITLGateOpenEvent`, and offer three operator actions (Approve, Rewrite, Reject) that each issue the correct sequence of HTTP calls to the HITL endpoints.
