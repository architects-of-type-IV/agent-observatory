# Task 3.5.3: WARNING Range (0.25 <= score < 0.50)

## Goal

When the score is within the WARNING band, `EntropyTracker` must broadcast a topology update setting the node to `:blocked` (amber) state and return `{:ok, score, :warning}`. No `EntropyAlertEvent` is emitted for WARNING severity. A prior WARNING state must not suppress a subsequent LOOP classification.

## Governing Decisions

- ADR-018

## Verification UCs

- UC-0244
- UC-0252
