## Issues Found and Resolved

1. **Gate 1 — Broken ADR link in FRD-010**: `ADR-020-webhook-reliability.md` corrected to `ADR-020-webhook-retry-dlq.md`.
2. **Gate 1 — Narrow source_adr in FRD-009**: Expanded from `[ADR-018]` to `[ADR-018, ADR-015, ADR-021]`.
3. **Gate 2 — FR-8.13, FR-9.2, FR-9.4, FR-9.6, FR-9.9**: No UC with matching `parent_fr:` in initial batch. Resolved by creating UC-0249 through UC-0253.
4. **Gate 2 — FR-10.8, FR-11.5, FR-11.6, FR-11.8**: No UC with matching `parent_fr:` in initial batch. Resolved by creating UC-0279 through UC-0282.
5. **Gate 2 — 12 Gherkin-AC mismatches**: Various UCs had scenario/AC count imbalances. Resolved by adding S3 Gherkin scenarios or supplemental test ACs as appropriate.
