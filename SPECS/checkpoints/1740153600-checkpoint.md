## Gate Results

| Gate | Result | Issues |
|------|--------|--------|
| Gate 1 (FRD Coverage + FR Consistency) | PASS (after fix) | 2 frontmatter `source_adr` mismatches fixed |
| Gate 2 (UC Completeness) | PASS | 18 minor Gherkin-AC mapping notes (non-blocking) |

## ADR Coverage

All 12 ADRs (ADR-001 through ADR-012) are covered by at least one FRD. Zero orphan decisions.

## Pipeline Execution

- Stage 1: 3 parallel FRD writers (batches A, B, C)
- Gate 1: 1 validator agent -- FAIL, 2 fixes applied, re-validated
- Stage 2: 3 parallel UC writers (batches A, B, C)
- Gate 2: 1 validator agent -- PASS

## Traceability Chain

```
Session JSONL -> Conversation (CONV-001..003) -> ADR (ADR-001..012) -> FRD (FRD-001..006) -> UC (UC-0001..0158)
```
