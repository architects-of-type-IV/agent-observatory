# Story 2.4.3: Dashboard Integration Wiring

## Delivers
Wire all new components and handlers into dashboard_live.ex, template, and JS.
SEQUENTIAL -- runs LAST after all agents complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
- :teams tab in header view switcher
- :teams view dispatch in template
- Inspector drawer renders below main content (always present)
- Tmux view renders when maximized
- Message composer in teams view
- All assigns initialized in mount
- All events routed in handle_event
- Keyboard shortcut 9 = teams view
- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` passes

## Files (SHARED -- only touched after parallel agents finish)
- `lib/observatory_web/live/dashboard_live.ex` (modify)
- `lib/observatory_web/live/dashboard_live.html.heex` (modify)
- `assets/js/app.js` (modify -- keyboard shortcut 9)
