# Task 2.1.1.2: Team health and progress aggregates

Goal: Compute team-level rollup metrics
Files: lib/observatory_web/live/dashboard_team_helpers.ex
Steps:
  1. Add `team_health(team)` -- aggregate member health (worst wins)
  2. Add `task_progress(team)` -- count completed vs total tasks
  3. Add `team_summary/1` combining health + progress + member count
Done when: `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` passes
