# Task 2.1.2.2: resolve_message_targets/2

Goal: Resolve a target scope to a list of session_ids
Files: lib/observatory_web/live/dashboard_team_helpers.ex
Steps:
  1. Add `resolve_message_targets(target, teams)` where target is:
     - {:all_teams} -> all agent_ids across all teams
     - {:team, name} -> all agent_ids in that team
     - {:all_leads} -> lead agent_id from each team
     - {:lead, team_name} -> lead of specific team
     - {:all_members, team_name} -> non-lead agent_ids
     - {:member, session_id} -> [session_id]
  2. Uses detect_role/2 to filter leads vs members
Done when: `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` passes
