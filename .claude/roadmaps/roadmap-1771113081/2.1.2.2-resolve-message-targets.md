# Task 2.1.2.2: resolve_message_targets/2

Goal: Resolve a target scope to a list of session_ids (v1: 4 scopes)
Files: lib/observatory_web/live/dashboard_team_inspector_handlers.ex (NOT team_helpers -- keeps helpers under 300 lines)
Steps:
  1. Add `resolve_message_targets(target, teams)` as private function in handler module
  2. v1 targets:
     - {:all_teams} -> all agent_ids across all teams
     - {:team, name} -> all agent_ids in that team
     - {:lead, team_name} -> lead of specific team (uses detect_role/2)
     - {:member, session_id} -> [session_id]
  3. v2 deferred: {:all_leads}, {:all_members, team_name}
  4. Uses DashboardTeamHelpers.detect_role/2 and team_member_sids/1
Done when: `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` passes
