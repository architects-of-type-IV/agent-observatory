# Task 2.4.3.0: Update prepare_assigns for team inspector

Goal: Add computed assigns for inspector events and team data
Files: lib/observatory_web/live/dashboard_live.ex (prepare_assigns/1)
Steps:
  1. Filter events by inspected team members' session_ids -> inspector_events assign
  2. Enrich inspected_teams with full team data from teams assign
  3. Compute inspector_visible_events based on output_mode + agent_toggles
  4. Remove stale inspected teams (team deleted mid-inspection)
Done when: `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` passes
