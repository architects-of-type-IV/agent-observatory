# Story 2.3.1: Tmux Tiled View with Output Modes

## Delivers
Maximized view with tmux-like tiled layout. Each inspected team gets a pane. Output mode switching filters what's shown.

## Acceptance Criteria
- CSS grid adapts to team count (1=full, 2=50/50, 3=2+1, 4=2x2)
- 6 global output mode buttons: all live, leads only, lead->members, members->lead, member<->member, all agents
- Per-pane: toggle individual agent output on/off
- Live event streaming filtered by session_id
- Auto-scroll with near-bottom detection
- Compact event line rendering
- Module under 300 lines
- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` passes

## Files (EXCLUSIVE to Agent C)
- `lib/observatory_web/components/team_tmux_components.ex` (create)
