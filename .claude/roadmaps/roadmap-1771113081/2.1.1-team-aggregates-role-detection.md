# Story 2.1.1: Team Aggregates & Role Detection

## Delivers
Functions that compute team-level health, task progress, and identify team leads vs members.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `detect_role/2` identifies lead vs member from team config
- `team_health/1` returns aggregate health (:healthy, :warning, :critical)
- `task_progress/1` returns {completed, total} task counts
- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` passes

## Files
- `lib/observatory_web/live/dashboard_team_helpers.ex` (modify)
