# Task 2.3.1.2: Event filtering by output mode

Goal: Filter events based on selected output mode (v1: 3 modes)
Files: lib/observatory_web/components/team_tmux_components.ex
Steps:
  1. Add filter_events_for_mode/3 (events, mode, team)
  2. v1 modes: :all_live (all events from team members), :leads_only (events from lead sessions only), :all_agents (events from all team members, same as all_live but explicit)
  3. Uses detect_role/2 to identify lead sessions for :leads_only
  4. v2 deferred: :lead_to_members, :members_to_lead, :member_to_member (require SendMessage payload parsing)
Done when: filtering correct for 3 v1 modes
