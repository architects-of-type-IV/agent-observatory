# Section 3.4: EntropyTracker Sliding Window

## Purpose

This section creates the `Observatory.Gateway.EntropyTracker` GenServer, establishes its private ETS sliding window data structure, and implements the `record_and_score/2` entry point including window eviction and the uniqueness ratio computation. These tasks cover FR-9.1 through FR-9.3 and must be complete before any severity classification, alerting, or `SchemaInterceptor` integration can be tested in isolation.
