# Task 3.5.2: LOOP Threshold Actions (score < 0.25)

## Goal

When the computed score is strictly less than the LOOP threshold, `EntropyTracker` must broadcast an `EntropyAlertEvent` to `"gateway:entropy_alerts"`, broadcast a topology state update with `state: "alert_entropy"` to `"gateway:topology"`, and return `{:ok, score, :loop}`. A score exactly equal to 0.25 must not trigger LOOP severity.

## Governing Decisions

- ADR-018
- ADR-021

## Verification UCs

- UC-0251
