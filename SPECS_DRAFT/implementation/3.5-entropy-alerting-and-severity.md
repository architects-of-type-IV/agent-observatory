# Section 3.5: Entropy Alerting & Severity

## Purpose

This section implements the uniqueness ratio computation and all three severity classification paths — LOOP (score < 0.25), WARNING (0.25 <= score < 0.50), and Normal (score >= 0.50) — along with their associated PubSub broadcasts and the `EntropyAlertEvent` construction and field-validation logic. These tasks cover FR-9.3 through FR-9.7 and must complete before the `SchemaInterceptor` integration in section 3.6 can be tested end-to-end.
