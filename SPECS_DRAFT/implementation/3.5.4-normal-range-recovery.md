# Task 3.5.4: Normal Range Recovery (score >= 0.50)

## Goal

When the score meets or exceeds the WARNING threshold, the session is classified as Normal. No alert is emitted. If the session was previously in WARNING or LOOP state, `EntropyTracker` must broadcast a topology update resetting the node to `:active` to clear the visual alert indicator. A score of exactly `0.50` is Normal, not WARNING.

## Governing Decisions

- ADR-018

## Verification UCs

- UC-0252
