# Task 1.3.1: Gateway Authoritative entropy_score

## Goal

The `cognition.entropy_score` submitted by an agent is treated as informational only. The Gateway must overwrite it with the value computed by `Observatory.Mesh.EntropyComputer.compute/1` before any PubSub broadcast. Placing this transformation as a named function on `DecisionLog` rather than inline in the Gateway keeps the schema module as the single point of authority for struct mutation and makes the overwrite step independently testable without spinning up the full Gateway pipeline.

## Governing Decisions

- ADR-014
- ADR-018

## Verification UCs

- UC-0206
