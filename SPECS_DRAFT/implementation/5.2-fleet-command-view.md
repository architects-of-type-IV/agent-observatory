# Section 5.2: Fleet Command View

## Purpose

This section builds out the full `FleetCommandComponents` module beyond the stub, implementing the six-panel layout: the Mesh Topology Map canvas as the dominant element, plus throughput, cost heatmap, infrastructure health, latency, and mTLS status secondary panels. All panels subscribe to the `swarm:update` PubSub topic and render graceful loading states when no data is present.
