# Task 5.2.1: FleetCommandComponents Panel Layout

## Goal

Implement the full `FleetCommandComponents.fleet_command_view/1` function component with a two-zone layout: a dominant canvas zone holding the Mesh Topology Map canvas element, and a secondary zone containing five named panel containers. All six layout elements must be present regardless of whether PubSub data has arrived.

## Governing Decisions

- ADR-022

## Verification UCs

- UC-0305
