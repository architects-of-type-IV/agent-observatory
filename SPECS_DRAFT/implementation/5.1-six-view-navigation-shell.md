# Section 5.1: Six-View Navigation Shell

## Purpose

This section wires the top-level navigation shell into `ObservatoryWeb.DashboardLive`: the six valid `view_mode` atoms with a `:fleet_command` default, keyboard shortcuts `1`–`6` and `Escape` via `phx-window-keydown`, localStorage persistence and recovery including graceful handling of legacy atom strings, and a `render/1` dispatch table that delegates to the six dedicated component modules. It covers FR-12.1 through FR-12.4.
