# Section 3.3: Canvas Topology Renderer (JS Hook)

## Purpose

This section creates `assets/js/hooks/topology_map.js`, the `Observatory.Gateway.TopologyBuilder` Elixir module, and establishes the `"gateway:topology"` PubSub broadcast contract. Together these five tasks cover FR-8.9 through FR-8.13 and complete the full data path from ETS DAG to Canvas pixel. No React or D3 dependency is introduced.
