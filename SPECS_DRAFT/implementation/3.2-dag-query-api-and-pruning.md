# Section 3.2: DAG Query API & Pruning

## Purpose

This section exposes the public read API (`get_session_dag/1`), specifies the delta broadcast format and emission rules, and implements session pruning triggered by `is_terminal` signals. Together these four tasks (covering FR-8.5 through FR-8.8) complete the server-side DAG subsystem. All downstream consumers — `TopologyBuilder`, the Session Drill-down LiveView, and the entropy integration test suite — depend on `get_session_dag/1` and the delta broadcast contract being stable before they can be wired.
