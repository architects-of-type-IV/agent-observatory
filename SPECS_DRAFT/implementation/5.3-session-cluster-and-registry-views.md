# Section 5.3: Session Cluster and Registry Views

## Purpose

This section implements the full `SessionClusterComponents` and `RegistryComponents` modules covering FR-12.7 and FR-12.8. The Session Cluster view provides an active session list with entropy filtering, a Causal DAG drill-down, a Live Scratchpad, a HITL Console, and collapsible sub-panels. The Registry view provides a sortable Capability Directory and a Routing Logic Manager form.
