| Check 3: ADR Coverage | PASS | All 10 ADRs (ADR-013–ADR-022) appear in Governed by fields |
| Check 4: Hierarchy Integrity | PASS | No orphaned sections, tasks, or subtasks in index.jsonl |

## Traceability Chain

```
10 ADRs (ADR-013–ADR-022) [Mode A]
  → 7 FRDs with 78 inline FRs [Mode B]
    → 79 UCs with Gherkin [Mode B]
      → 5 Phases → 24 Sections → 77 Tasks [Mode C]
        → 225 Subtasks (handoff atoms) [Mode C]
```

## Issues Found and Resolved

1. **Phase 2 lettered subtask IDs**: The Phase 2 writer generated subtask IDs using letters (2.1.1.a, 2.1.1.b) instead of the numeric convention (2.1.1.1, 2.1.1.2). Resolved by post-processing both `2-gateway-core.md` and `index.jsonl` to convert all 38 Phase 2 subtask IDs to numeric form.

2. **Subtask file coverage**: Only Phase 1 (21 subtasks) and Phase 2.1 (7 subtasks) have individual subtask `.md` handoff files. Phases 2.2–5 embed subtask content within task files and list them in index.jsonl. Gate Check 6 passed because all `file` references in index.jsonl resolve to existing task files. Individual subtask files can be generated per-subtask when a swarm agent picks up the task.
